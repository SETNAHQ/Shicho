(Cities: Skylines mod)

Fundamental support mod for hardcore sandbox builders & streamers.

This mod aims to provide some missing core features for hardcore builders. Unlike the aggressive unlimiter in classic mods, Shicho does critical modifications with better way of overriding & patching to avoid technical disadvantages such as broken AI. Even if a feature is a game changer, Shicho aims to keep side-effects for the game simulation to be minimal.
